# MySQL2MongoDB
Short code for migrating MySQL tables to MongoDB collections via Python

You will need these libraries:
  pymongo, mysql.connector
  
Also please note code is for small tables ( it depends on your server or pc resources)

It can be very easily modified to others SQL databases (MS SQL, Postgresql, Oracle ... )
